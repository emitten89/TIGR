# Crowd-sourced COVID-19 Dataset Tracking Involuntary Government Restrictions (TIGR)

Step 1: Think of a restriction you heard a government imposing to try to fight COVID-19, like...

On March 12th, Ohio banned gatherings of more than 100 people

On March 15th, Saudi Arabia banned flights to and from hotspot countries

On March 10, New Rochelle, NY closed schools and businesses other than grocery stores

Any example back to December 1, 2019 welcome!

Step 2: Find an online news article that documents that restriction

[Google News](https://news.google.com/search?q=covid&hl=en-US)

[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/)

[Wikipedia's citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic)

Step 3: Convince yourself that the restriction was

- By a government

- Mandatory (legally required)

- New (a change to the previous rules)


and was not ....

-A recomendation  (CDC recommending canceling gatherings of more than 50 people)

-Private  (Google requested its employees transition to working remotely)

-Pre-existing  (Don't report that China currently has a ban on flights now, only report if China made the CHANGE on the date you give)

## Introduction 

This is a crowdsourced data collection effort to record new mandatory government restrictions intended to slow the spread of COVID-19.

----->[Submit a Report of a Government Restriction](https://forms.gle/ESytGHMzUTvNf6RJA) <------------

We don't know the answers to two important questions:

1) How government interventions changes the rate of growth in COVID19 spread within a community

2) What determines when governments will implement some interventions rather than others

We WANT reports of restrictions that are

* By a government

* Mandatory (legally required)

* New (a change to the previous rules)

For example:

* On March 12th, Ohio banned gatherings of more than 100 people.

* On March 15th, Saudi Arabia banned flights to and from hotspot countries.

* On March 10, New Rochelle, NY closed schools and businesses other than grocery stores and delis.

We DO NOT want:

* VOLUNTARY restrictions (CDC recommending canceling gatherings of more than 50 people)

* PRIVATE restrictions (Google requested its employees transition to working remotely)

* CURRENT policies (Don't report that China currently has a ban on flights now, only report if China made the CHANGE on the date you give)


Historical reports are welcome! (back to December 1, 2019)

Duplicate reports are fine, don't worry if it has already been submitted.

No personal information is requested, and the results will be made public for academic research.

Survey administered by Rex W. Douglass (PhD) ([@RexDouglass](https://twitter.com/RexDouglass/status/1240033447948648449)), who will post results and further details as the project evolves  here.
